## Project Overview ##
The aim of this project is to develop and validate a digital droplet PCR multiplex assay that sensitively and specifically tests for outbreak pathogens in wastewater liquids and solids. In the creation of the assay, it was necessary to test different reaction mixtures to see which would perform best. This dashboard will compare two reaction mixes, Supermix no-DUTP, and RT Supermix. 
-	How did fluorescence differ across targets and reaction mixes (Plotly violin plot)
-	How did detected DNA/RNA copies / µl of sample differ across reaction mixes? (DT table)

### Key variables ###
Key variables include pathogen (categorical–– M. tuberculosis, N. meningitidis, B. pertussis, measles), reaction mix (categorical–– Supermix no-DUTP and RT Supermix), fluorescence (number of positive partitions), and DNA/RNA (gene copies / µl). 

### Importance/impact ###
The results of this test have informed our selection of reaction mix in subsequent tests and assay development. In the greater scheme of public health, multiplex assays that effectively test for pathogens in environmental samples add novelty to the field.
